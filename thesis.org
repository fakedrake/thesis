* Abstract

  My work for extracting relational information from wikipedia for the
  use of MiT InfoLab's START is divided in two parts: wikipediabase,
  directly communicating with an instance of wikipedia.org to answer
  queries posed by START, and, wikipedia mirror, a program for
  generating full wikipedia.org mirror on a local machine.
