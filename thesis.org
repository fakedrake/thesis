* Abstract

  MiT InfoLab's START (SynTactic Analysis using Reversible
  Transformations) is the world's first web-based question answering
  system. For accessing most data sources it takes advantage of
  Omnibase, the /"virtual database"/ providing uniform access to
  multiple sources on the web. We developed WikipediaBase to provide
  an Omnibase-like way for START to access unstructured and
  semi-structured information in Wikipedia. As part of this goal we
  also created wikipedia-mirror, a program to create Wikipedia clones
  that can be run locally, to provide control and unrestricted access
  to the wikipedia data set without depending on or abusing
  wikipedia.org.
